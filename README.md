# PG-DBA-Tools
A graphical tool for managing Postgresql servers

This tool is based on Melvin Davidson queries found on postgres-general mailing list.
The intent is to help on DBA tasks for PostgreSQL

The choice of QT Framework was based on portability isues.
The PostgreSQL libpq will be used instead qpsql to avoid possible limitations. 
This will bring a little more work but also the benefits of total compatibility

A graphical tool for managing Postgresql servers


This tool is based on Melvin Davidson queries found on postgres-general mailing list.
I found it on https://github.com/JohnArchieMckown/PostgreSQL-DBA-tools (you can find
the originals here), I made some modifications on the queries to adapt then to the newer versions and divided then on 
diferent folders by category. 
Some new queres were added to adapt the tool to the new versions of PostgreSQL

The intent is to help on DBA tasks for PostgreSQL

The choice of QT Framework was based on portability isues.
The PostgreSQL libpq will be used instead qpsql to avoid possible limitations. 
This will bring a little more work but also the benefits of total compatibility

Any sugestion are wellcome!

**Notes:**

About some false positives on QtCreator - Q_Object (incomplete type) - Please disable clang options on menu /help/about plugins
See configuration to choose the web engine
